   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Blend
=====
Merge, analyze, and optimize client-side assets for web applications and static web sites.

Introduction
============

Blend was inspired by the asset pipeline introduced in Ruby on Rails 3.1 (http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html)

You can create a configuration file to control how Blend analyzes, merges, and optimizes your files, but you don't have
to. Without a configuration file, running ``blend`` in your project directory will:

- Search for any javascript or css files containing blend formatted require statements.
- Run JSLint on the javascript files.
- Recursively merge required files.
- Write the merged files to the ``output`` directory.
- Write the merged files to the ``output`` directory.
- Use the YUI compressor to create minified versions of the files in the ``output`` directory.

Installation
============

From the Python Package Index
-----------------------------
::

    pip install blend

From Source
-----------
::

    git clone git://github.com/azavea/blend.git
    cd blend
    python setup.py install

Usage
=====

The ``blend`` command line tool is designed to process a directory full of files or individually specified files. Given
the following directory structure::

    project
      lib
        jquery.min.js
      src
        app.js

And the following ``app.js``::

    /* app.js */

    //= require jquery
    var app = {};

Running ``blend`` in the ``project`` directory will result in the following directory tree structure::

    project
      lib
        jquery.min.js
      output
        app.js
        app.min.js
      src
        app.js

Where the content of ``project/output/app.js`` is ``project/lib/jquery.min.js`` merged into ``project/src/app.js`` and
``project/output/app.min.js`` is the minified version of ``project/output/app.js``

Command Line Options
--------------------

Output
~~~~~~
``-o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT``

Where the file output will be written. The default is a directory at the root of the
project directory named ``output``

Path
~~~~~
``-p PATH, --path=PATH``

A directory to be searched for required files. Multiple directories can specified by
repeating the flag. If you do not
specify any directory with the PATH flag then only the working directory will be searched for required files.

Skip Working Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``-s, --skipcwd``

Exclude the current working directory from the requirement search paths.

.. warning::

   If you do not specify any paths using the -p,--path option and you also specify the -s,--skipcwd option then Blend
   will have no directories in which to search for required files and will be unable to merge your code.


Adding Requirements To Files
=================================

For javascript files, Blend uses the same require syntax as the Rails 3.1 asset compiler.::

    //= require jquery

For CSS files, Blend will recognize comment requires::

    /*= require control */

Blend will also recognize ``@import url("...")`` statements in CSS files and treat them as require statements::

    @import url("control.css")

.. note:: ``require`` comments reference other files using a "base name." You **must not** include the file extension or version numbers or ``min`` suffixes. Blend strips these suffixes out of the file name when searching for files to satisfy a requirement.

How Blend Satisfies Requirements
================================

By default, Blend recursively searches in the directory from which it is run for files to satisfy requirements. You
can suppress this behavior with the ``-s, --skipcwd`` argument and you can add additional search paths using the
``-p, --path`` argument.

Searching By Base Name
----------------------
Given the following file::

    /* app.js */

    //= require jquery
    var app = {};

When you run::

    blend app.js

Blend will search for a file with a base name of ``jquery`` and a ``.js`` extension. **Any** of the following files would
satisfy this requirement::

    JQUERY.js
    jquery.javascript
    jQuErY.js
    jquery-1.2.3.js
    JQUERy.min.js
    jquery-1.2.3-min.js

**None** of these files would satisfy this requirement::

    jjquery.js
    jquery123.js
    jquery.jscript
    jquery-minified.js

Search Priority
---------------
Blend will prefer to satisfy a requirement with a file in the same directory as the requiring file or a subdirectory
of the requiring file. Given this ``app.js``::

    /* app.js */

    //= require component
    var app = {};

and this directory structure::

    project
      lib
        component.js
      src
        app.js
        components
          component.js  <- this file will be merged with app.js

The ``component.js`` file nested under ``src/components`` will "win."

Analyzers
=========
By default, Blend runs JSLint on all the javascript files it processes. This can generate failures when you are merging
in 3rd party libraries that do not pass JSLint. To get around this problem, the default JSLint analyzer is configured
to ignore any files that are under a ``lib`` directory at the root of the project folder.

Given the following ``app.js``::

    /* app.js */

    //= require jquery
    var app = {};

Running ``blend`` in this directory structure::

    project
      src
        app.js
        jquery.min.js

Will fail because the minified JQuery library will not pass a JSLint check. However, if you move the JQuery file so the
directory structure looks like this::

    project
      lib
        jquery.min.js
      src
        app.js

Then running ``blend`` will succeed because the JSLint analyzer will skip over ``project/lib/jquery.min.js``.

What's Missing
==============

The default Blend configuration cannot be overridden using a project level configuration file.
